rest-doc-generator is generates and displays HTML documentation from RESTspec 
IDL and Data Schema files. The code is in prototype state and is
currently broken due to ongoing changes to the RESTspec IDL format.


To set up your environment for the rest doc generator:

From the current directory, do:

$ sudo easy_install virtualenv
$ virtualenv .
$ source bin/activate
$ easy_install flask
$ easy_install watchdog

Now you should be able to run

$ python docgen.py

To exit the environment, run:

$ deactivate
