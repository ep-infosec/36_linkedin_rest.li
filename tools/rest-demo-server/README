To set up your environment for the rest server demo:

The server requires mongodb. Install mongodb using port or just by downloading
it off the mongodb website (note if you do it manually you'll have to create
a data/db directory and point mongod to that), and run the mongod server.

Then, you can set up your python environment. From the current directory, do:

$ sudo easy_install virtualenv
$ virtualenv .
$ source bin/activate
$ easy_install flask
$ easy_install pymongo

Now you should be able to run

$ python memberserver.py

To exit the environment, run:

$ deactivate
